# SmartPriorities: Introduction
Smart Priorities significantly improves task management by introducing an innovative smart sorting feature. This feature automatically organizes tasks based on a sophisticated algorithm that considers multiple factors including due date, urgency, linked tasks, and category-specific attributes. Designed to enhance productivity and efficiency, Smart Priorities empowers users to prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring optimal workflow and goal achievement.

# Core Features
The cornerstone of Smart Priorities is its smart sorting feature. This advanced functionality evaluates tasks based on several criteria to determine their priority:

**Due Date:** Tasks nearing their deadline are moved higher in the list, indicating that the user must complete them first.
**Urgency:** High-priority tasks flagged as urgent are moved to the top of the list.
**Linked Tasks:** Tasks connected to others are sorted in connection with related tasks.
**Category-Specific Attributes:** If tasks categorized under work study, contracts, people or/and health, they are moved closer to the top of the list to receive more attention.

**This intelligent sorting system ensures that users always have a clear, prioritized view of their tasks to see what should be done first, reducing stress of uncertainty, confusion in the large number of tasks.**

# Advantages
**Optimized Workflow**: By presenting tasks in a prioritized manner, Task Manager helps users focus on what's most important, optimizing their workflow.
**Reduced Overwhelm**: Users can quickly assess their task load and prioritize accordingly, minimizing feelings of being overwhelmed.
**Enhanced Focus**: With tasks neatly organized and prioritized, users can concentrate on completing high-value tasks first.

# Get Started
At this point, the application can be opened and run from NetBeans by following these steps: 
1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Install the MySQL database "taskmanager" from the \database folder.
3. Run the project in NetBeans.

The status is currently logged in with user ID 1, so it loads and sorts the existing tasks from the database in the to-do list on the right panel.

4. In the left panel, you can add a new task to the database.
_(will be fixed later: the task is shown in the to-do list only after restarting the application)_
